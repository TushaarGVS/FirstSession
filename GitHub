git init to make a directory a repository.
read files = untracked.
working areas: untracked work, tracked, commited
to track = git add.
green files = tracked.
git commit -m "Some Message" = commits all the tracked files = saves to current repo.
git log to check the logs.
git diff = diff. b/w last untracked and last tracked.
git reset hashvalue of commit= resets all the commits.
git reset hard = changes the working directory = removes the current commit only.

git checkout filename.

local and remote/global repos
Local repo's can inherit from many repos.
make local and inherit in remote = git remote add origin https://github.com/TushaarGVS/Pro.git
make repo and inherit in local = use clone

git push -u origin master = to push from local to remote.
git pull -u origin master = to pull from remote to local.

-u only for the first time as we are are inheriting to an empty repo. 

git clone <url>
fork any repo and start working with it and send pull requests. 

git branch = commit access to everyone, they can push to the repo.
git checkout -b <branch_name> = -b: creating new branch.

master = master branch.
HEAD is the last commit.

git merge: merges the branches with master.
git rebase: It goes the common commit of the diff. branches and master = best command to create pull requests.

Never work on master branch.
Travis CI and Appveyor = continuous integration agents.
Travis = tests your code and checks for various inputs -runs entire code on Linux and Mac OSX and gives result.
Appveyor = works on windows and gives result.
